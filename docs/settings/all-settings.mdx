# Language Model

### Model Selection

Specifies which language model to use. Check out the [models](/language-models/) section for a list of available models. Probe uses [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) under the hood to support over 100+ models.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --model "gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

```python Python
probe.llm.model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  model: gpt-3.5-turbo
```

</CodeGroup>

### Temperature

Sets the randomness level of the model's output. The default temperature is 0, you can set it to any value between 0 and 1. The higher the temperature, the more random and creative the output will be.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --temperature 0.7
```

```python Python
probe.llm.temperature = 0.7
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  temperature: 0.7
```

</CodeGroup>

### Context Window

Manually set the context window size in tokens for the model. For local models, using a smaller context window will use less RAM, which is more suitable for most devices.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --context_window 16000
```

```python Python
probe.llm.context_window = 16000
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  context_window: 16000
```

</CodeGroup>

### Max Tokens

Sets the maximum number of tokens that the model can generate in a single response.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --max_tokens 100
```

```python Python
probe.llm.max_tokens = 100
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  max_tokens: 100
```

</CodeGroup>

### Max Output

Set the maximum number of characters for code outputs.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --max_output 1000
```

```python Python
probe.llm.max_output = 1000
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  max_output: 1000
```

</CodeGroup>

### API Base

If you are using a custom API, specify its base URL with this argument.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --api_base "https://api.example.com"
```

```python Python
probe.llm.api_base = "https://api.example.com"
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  api_base: https://api.example.com
```

</CodeGroup>

### API Key

Set your API key for authentication when making API calls. For OpenAI models, you can get your API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --api_key "your_api_key_here"
```

```python Python
probe.llm.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  api_key: your_api_key_here
```

</CodeGroup>

### API Version

Optionally set the API version to use with your selected model. (This will override environment variables)

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --api_version 2.0.2
```

```python Python
probe.llm.api_version = '2.0.2'
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  api_version: 2.0.2
```

</CodeGroup>

### LLM Supports Functions

Inform Probe that the language model you're using supports function calling.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --llm_supports_functions
```

```python Python
probe.llm.supports_functions = True
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  supports_functions: true
```

</CodeGroup>

### LLM Does Not Support Functions

Inform Probe that the language model you're using does not support function calling.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --no-llm_supports_functions
```

```python Python
probe.llm.supports_functions = False
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  supports_functions: false
```

</CodeGroup>

### Execution Instructions

If `llm.supports_functions` is `False`, this value will be added to the system message. This parameter tells language models how to execute code. This can be set to an empty string or to `False` if you don't want to tell the LLM how to do this.

<CodeGroup>

````python Python
probe.llm.execution_instructions = "To execute code on the user's machine, write a markdown code block. Specify the language after the ```. You will receive the output. Use any programming language."
````

````python Profile
probe.llm.execution_instructions = "To execute code on the user's machine, write a markdown code block. Specify the language after the ```. You will receive the output. Use any programming language."
````

</CodeGroup>

### LLM Supports Vision

Inform Probe that the language model you're using supports vision. Defaults to `False`.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --llm_supports_vision
```

```python Python
probe.llm.supports_vision = True
```

```yaml Profile
llm:
  supports_vision: true
```

</CodeGroup>

# Probe

### Vision Mode

Enables vision mode, which adds some special instructions to the prompt and switches to `gpt-4o`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Terminal
probe --vision
```

```python Python
probe.llm.model = "gpt-4o" # Any vision supporting model
probe.llm.supports_vision = True
probe.llm.supports_functions = True

probe.custom_instructions = """The user will show you an image of the code you write. You can view images directly.
For HTML: This will be run STATELESSLY. You may NEVER write '<!-- previous code here... --!>' or `<!-- header will go here -->` or anything like that. It is CRITICAL TO NEVER WRITE PLACEHOLDERS. Placeholders will BREAK it. You must write the FULL HTML CODE EVERY TIME. Therefore you cannot write HTML piecemeal—write all the HTML, CSS, and possibly Javascript **in one step, in one code block**. The user will help you review it visually.
If the user submits a filepath, you will also see the image. The filepath and user image will both be in the user's message.
If you use `plt.show()`, the resulting image will be sent to you. However, if you use `PIL.Image.show()`, the resulting image will NOT be sent to you."""
```

```yaml Profile
loop: True

llm:
  model: "gpt-4o"
  temperature: 0
  supports_vision: True
  supports_functions: True
  context_window: 110000
  max_tokens: 4096
  custom_instructions: >
    The user will show you an image of the code you write. You can view images directly.

max_budget: 0.01
```

</CodeGroup>

### Local Mode

Run the model locally. Check the [models page](/language-models/local-models/lm-studio) for more information.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --local
```

```python Python
from probe import probe

probe.offline = True # Disables online features like Open Procedures
probe.llm.model = "openai/x" # Tells OI to send messages in OpenAI's format
probe.llm.api_key = "fake_key" # LiteLLM, which we use to talk to local models, requires this
probe.llm.api_base = "http://localhost:1234/v1" # Point this at any OpenAI compatible server

probe.chat()
```

```yaml Profile
local: true
```

</CodeGroup>

### Fast Mode

Sets the model to gpt-3.5-turbo and encourages it to only write code without confirmation.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --fast
```

```yaml Profile
fast: true
```

</CodeGroup>

### Custom Instructions

Appends custom instructions to the system message. This is useful for adding information about your system, preferred languages, etc.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --custom_instructions "This is a custom instruction."
```

```python Python
probe.custom_instructions = "This is a custom instruction."
```

```yaml Profile
custom_instructions: "This is a custom instruction."
```

</CodeGroup>

### System Message

We don't recommend modifying the system message, as doing so opts you out of future updates to the core system message. Use `--custom_instructions` instead, to add relevant information to the system message. If you must modify the system message, you can do so by using this argument, or by changing a profile file.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --system_message "You are Probe..."
```

```python Python
probe.system_message = "You are Probe..."
```

```yaml Profile
system_message: "You are Probe..."
```

</CodeGroup>

### Disable Telemetry

Opt out of [telemetry](telemetry/telemetry).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
probe --disable_telemetry
```

```python Python
probe.anonymized_telemetry = False
```

```yaml Profile
disable_telemetry: true
```

</CodeGroup>

### Offline

This boolean flag determines whether to enable or disable some offline features like [open procedures](https://open-procedures.replit.app/). Use this in conjunction with the `model` parameter to set your language model.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
probe.offline = True
```

```bash Terminal
probe --offline true
```

```yaml Profile
offline: true
```

</CodeGroup>

### Messages

This property holds a list of `messages` between the user and the probe.

You can use it to restore a conversation:

```python
probe.chat("Hi! Can you print hello world?")

print(probe.messages)

# This would output:

# [
#    {
#       "role": "user",
#       "message": "Hi! Can you print hello world?"
#    },
#    {
#       "role": "assistant",
#       "message": "Sure!"
#    }
#    {
#       "role": "assistant",
#       "language": "python",
#       "code": "print('Hello, World!')",
#       "output": "Hello, World!"
#    }
# ]

#You can use this to restore `probe` to a previous conversation.
probe.messages = messages # A list that resembles the one above
```

### User Message Template

A template applied to the User's message. `{content}` will be replaced with the user's message, then sent to the language model.

<CodeGroup>

````python Python
probe.user_message_template = "{content} Please send me some code that would be able to answer my question, in the form of ```python\n... the code ...\n``` or ```shell\n... the code ...\n```"
````

```python Profile
probe.user_message_template = "{content}. Be concise, don't include anything unnecessary. Don't use placeholders, I can't edit code."
```

</CodeGroup>

### Always Apply User Message Template

The boolean flag for whether the User Message Template will be applied to every user message. The default is False which means the template is only applied to the last User message.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
probe.always_apply_user_message_template = False
```

```python Profile
probe.always_apply_user_message_template = False
```

</CodeGroup>

### Code Message Template

A template applied to the Computer's output after running code. `{content}` will be replaced with the computer's output, then sent to the language model.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
probe.code_output_template = "Code output: {content}\nWhat does this output mean / what's next (if anything, or are we done)?"
```

```python Profile
probe.code_output_template = "Code output: {content}\nWhat code needs to be run next?"
```

</CodeGroup>

### Empty Code Message Template

If the computer does not output anything after code execution, this value will be sent to the language model.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
probe.empty_code_output_template = "The code above was executed on my machine. It produced no text output. what's next (if anything, or are we done?)"
```

```python Profile
probe.empty_code_output_template = "The code above was executed on my machine. It produced no text output. what's next?"
```

</CodeGroup>

### Code Output Sender

This field determines whether the computer / code output messages are sent as the assistant or as the user. The default is user.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
probe.code_output_sender = "user"
```

```python Profile
probe.code_output_sender = "assistant"
```

</CodeGroup>

# Computer

The `computer` object in `probe.computer` is a virtual computer that the AI controls. Its primary interface/function is to execute code and return the output in real-time.

### Offline

Running the `computer` in offline mode will disable some online features, like the hosted [Computer API](https://api.probe.com/). Inherits from `probe.offline`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
probe.computer.offline = True
```

```yaml Profile
computer.offline: True
```

</CodeGroup>

### Verbose

This is primarily used for debugging `probe.computer`. Inherits from `probe.verbose`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
probe.computer.verbose = True
```

```yaml Profile
computer.verbose: True
```

</CodeGroup>

### Emit Images

The `emit_images` attribute in `probe.computer` controls whether the computer should emit images or not. This is inherited from `probe.llm.supports_vision`.

This is used for multimodel vs. text only models. Running `computer.display.view()` will return an actual screenshot for multimodal models if `emit_images` is True. If it's False, `computer.display.view()` will return all the text on the screen.

Many other functions of the computer can produce image/text outputs, and this parameter controls that.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
probe.computer.emit_images = True
```

```yaml Profile
computer.emit_images: True
```

</CodeGroup>

### Import Computer API

Include the computer API in the system message. The default is False and won't import the computer API automatically

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
probe.computer.import_computer_api = True
```

```yaml Profile
computer.import_computer_api: True
```

</CodeGroup>
````
