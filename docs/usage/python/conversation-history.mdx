title: Conversation History
---

Conversations will be saved in your application directory. **This is true for python and for the terminal interface.**

The command below, when run in your terminal, will show you which folder they're being saved in (use your arrow keys to move down and press enter over `> Open Folder`):

```shell
probe --conversations
```

You can turn off conversation history for a particular conversation:

```python
from probe import probe

probe.conversation_history = False
probe.chat() # Conversation history will not be saved
```
