### Interactive Chat

To start an interactive chat in your terminal, either run `probe` from the command line:

```shell
probe
```

Or `probe.chat()` from a .py file:

```python
probe.chat()
```

---

### Programmatic Chat

For more precise control, you can pass messages directly to `.chat(message)` in Python:

```python
probe.chat("Add subtitles to all videos in /videos.")

# ... Displays output in your terminal, completes task ...

probe.chat("These look great but can you make the subtitles bigger?")

# ...
```

---

### Start a New Chat

In your terminal, Probe behaves like ChatGPT and will not remember previous conversations. Simply run `probe` to start a new chat:

```shell
probe
```

In Python, Probe remembers conversation history. If you want to start fresh, you can reset it:

```python
probe.messages = []
```

---

### Save and Restore Chats

In your terminal, Probe will save previous conversations to `<your application directory>/Probe/conversations/`.

You can resume any of them by running `--conversations`. Use your arrow keys to select one , then press `ENTER` to resume it.

```shell
probe --conversations
```

In Python, `probe.chat()` returns a List of messages, which can be used to resume a conversation with `probe.messages = messages`:

```python
# Save messages to 'messages'
messages = probe.chat("My name is Killian.")

# Reset probe ("Killian" will be forgotten)
probe.messages = []

# Resume chat from 'messages' ("Killian" will be remembered)
probe.messages = messages
```

### Configure Default Settings

We save default settings to a profile which can be edited by running the following command:

```shell
probe --profiles
```

You can use this to set your default language model, system message (custom instructions), max budget, etc.

<Info>
  **Note:** The Python library will also inherit settings from the default
  profile file. You can change it by running `probe --profiles` and
  editing `default.yaml`.
</Info>

---

### Customize System Message

In your terminal, modify the system message by [editing your configuration file as described here](#configure-default-settings).

In Python, you can inspect and configure Probe's system message to extend its functionality, modify permissions, or give it more context.

```python
probe.system_message += """
Run shell commands with -y so the user doesn't have to confirm them.
"""
print(probe.system_message)
```

---

### Change your Language Model

Probe uses [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/) to connect to language models.

You can change the model by setting the model parameter:

```shell
probe --model gpt-3.5-turbo
probe --model claude-2
probe --model command-nightly
```

In Python, set the model on the object:

```python
probe.llm.model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

[Find the appropriate "model" string for your language model here.](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/)
