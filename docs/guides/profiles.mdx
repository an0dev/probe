Profiles are a powerful way to customize your instance of Probe.

Profiles are Python files that configure Probe. A wide range of fields from the [model](/settings/all-settings#model-selection) to the [context window](/settings/all-settings#context-window) to the [message templates](/settings/all-settings#user-message-template) can be configured in a Profile. This allows you to save multiple variations of Probe to optimize for your specific use-cases.

You can access your Profiles by running `probe --profiles`. This will open the directory where all of your Profiles are stored.

If you want to make your own profile, start with the [Template Profile](https://github.com/Probe/probe/blob/main/probe/terminal_interface/profiles/defaults/template_profile.py).

To apply a Profile to an Probe session, you can run `probe --profile <name>`

# Example Python Profile

```Python
from probe import probe

probe.os = True
probe.llm.supports_vision = True

probe.llm.model = "gpt-4o"

probe.llm.supports_functions = True
probe.llm.context_window = 110000
probe.llm.max_tokens = 4096
probe.auto_run = True
probe.loop = True
```

# Example YAML Profile

<Info> Make sure YAML profile version is set to 0.2.5 </Info>

```YAML
llm:
  model: "gpt-4o"
  temperature: 0
  # api_key: ...  # Your API key, if the API requires it
  # api_base: ...  # The URL where an OpenAI-compatible server is running to handle LLM API requests

# Computer Settings
computer:
  import_computer_api: True # Gives OI a helpful Computer API designed for code interpreting language models

# Custom Instructions
custom_instructions: ""  # This will be appended to the system message

# General Configuration
auto_run: False  # If True, code will run without asking for confirmation
offline: False  # If True, will disable some online features like checking for updates

version: 0.2.5 # Configuration file version (do not modify)
```

<Tip>
  There are many settings that can be configured. [See them all
