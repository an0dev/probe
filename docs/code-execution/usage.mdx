# Running Code

The `computer` itself is separate from Probe's core, so you can run it independently:

```python
from probe import probe

probe.computer.run("python", "print('Hello World!')")
```

This runs in the same Python instance that probe uses, so you can define functions, variables, or log in to services before the AI starts running code:

```python
probe.computer.run("python", "import replicate\nreplicate.api_key='...'")

probe.custom_instructions = "Replicate has already been imported."

probe.chat("Please generate an image on replicate...") # Probe will be logged into Replicate
```

# Custom Languages

You also have control over the `computer`'s languages (like Python, Javascript, and Shell), and can easily append custom languages:
